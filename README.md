# Hi and welcome to my repoHive!

I'm LouisCyfer, creator, developer and maintainer of this page and more (hopefully helpful) stuff.

If you wonder "What is this ’ThinkOutsideTheCubicle’ organisation?" then that's simple.

It's me and [DariaLapin](https://github.com/DariaLapin) releasing stuff for fun, not beeing associated somewhere, basicially in a private scale.

We also have a [blog](https://cubesoutside.wordpress.com/) on wordpress.com where we are writing, you can comment there too.

> Note: our repositories moved over to GitLab!
